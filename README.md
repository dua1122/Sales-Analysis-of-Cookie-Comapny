This project presents a comprehensive analysis of sales performance for a multi-national cookie manufacturer. The interactive Excel dashboard visualizes transactional data to identify key performance indicators and profitability drivers. The analysis reveals a Total Profit of $2,113,710 and a Total Sales Volume of 861,150 units.

Key insights indicate that Chocolate Chip cookies are the primary revenue driver, while the United Kingdom and United States are the top-performing markets. Significant seasonal spikes were observed in June, October, and December.

The objective of this analysis is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights regarding profitability across different geographies and product lines. By leveraging historical sales data, this dashboard answers the following business questions:

Which cookie types generate the highest profit margins?

How does sales performance vary across the five key countries (UK, US, India, Malaysia, Philippines)?

What are the seasonal trends impacting unit sales and profitability?

**3. Methodology**

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, utilizing the following process:

Data Processing: Raw sales data was aggregated using Pivot Tables.

Visualization: Designed a dynamic dashboard featuring:

Stacked Bar Chart: For comparing profit by Country and Cookie type.

Line Charts: To visualize monthly trends in Units Sold and Profit.

Pie Charts: To show percentage distribution of profit by Product and Country.

Interactivity: Integrated Slicers for Month, Country, and Product to allow for granular drill-downs.

🗓 Temporal Trends

Seasonality: Distinct spikes in sales and profit are observed in June, October, and December, likely driven by mid-year promotions and end-of-year holiday demand.

Low Periods: Sales dips were recorded in February, May, and September, indicating potential off-season challenges.

**5. Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

Inventory Optimization for Peaks: Increase stock levels by 15-20% leading up to June, October, and December to maximize the identified demand surges.

Revitalize "Off-Peak" Months: Launch targeted marketing campaigns or "Buy-One-Get-One" offers during February and September to smooth out the sales curve.

Focus on Top Markets: Continue to strengthen the stronghold in the UK and US with premium product bundles (e.g., Chocolate Chip + Macadamia).

Growth in Emerging Markets: Investigate specific barriers in the Philippines (17%) to bring its contribution closer to parity with the top regions.

**6. Conclusion**

The dashboard successfully identifies that the company has a strong, balanced portfolio with Chocolate Chip as the "Star" product. While overall performance is robust, addressing the seasonal dips in Q1 and Q3 could significantly boost annual profitability.
